# IESDS
# IESDS.java performs iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS)

# this is applicable in game theory to remove any strategy that is irrational - e.g., an agent should never play it. 
# strict domination of a strategy can be achieved by any combination of strategies. E.g. A can be dominated by {(1/3, B), (1/3, C), (1/3, D)}
